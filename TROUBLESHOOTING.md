# Getting the code to run:

Build with:

    mvn clean package

After building, the demo can be run from the command line:

    mvn -q exec:java

This code was originally tested on Ubuntu 17.04 with:
* Intellij 2017 (File -> Open)
* Netbeans 8.2
* Eclipse 4.6.3 _with m2e-apt installed_ (File-> Import... -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects).

Github Actions now run with Java 11 and 17 on Linux.

# Trouble shooting:

Note: Eclipse **must** have annotation processor support installed and enabled!  

The m2e-apt plugin can be downloaded from the Eclipse
Marketplace or https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/m2e-apt (which
also has configuration instructions).  

Ensure that Preferences ->
Maven -> Annotation Processing is set to "Automatically configure JDT
APT" **or this will not work**.

If the Dagger classes are not automatically generated by the IDE when
opened (happens with older versions of IntelliJ and Eclipse without
m2e-apt enabled), build with Maven first.
