# Getting the code to run:

Build with:

    mvn clean package

After building, the demo can be run from the command line:

    mvn -q exec:java

This code has been tested on Ubuntu 17.04 with:
* Intellij 2017 (File -> Open)
* Netbeans 8.2
* Eclipse 4.6.3 _with m2e-apt installed_ (File-> Import... -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects).

# Trouble shooting:

Note: Eclipse **must** have annotation processor support installed
and enabled!  

The m2e-apt plugin can be downloaded from the Eclipse
Marketplace or https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/m2e-apt (which
also has configuration instructions).  

Ensure that Preferences ->
Maven -> Annotation Processing is set to "Automatically configure JDT
APT" or this will not work.

If the Dagger classes are not automatically generated by the IDE when
opened (happens with older versions of IntelliJ and Eclipse without
m2e-apt enabled), build with Maven first.
